# ColibrìDB Internals Documentation

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive, line-by-line analysis of ColibrìDB's internal implementation, data structures, algorithms, and design decisions. This documentation is intended for developers who need to understand the deep technical details of the system.

## Table of Contents

1. [Core Architecture](01-core-architecture.md) - System design and component relationships
2. [Database Engine](02-database-engine.md) - Main database class and lifecycle
3. [Storage Layer](03-storage-layer.md) - Page management and file I/O
4. [Buffer Management](04-buffer-management.md) - LRU buffer pool implementation
5. [Index Structures](05-index-structures.md) - B+Tree, ART, LSM-Tree implementations
6. [Transaction System](06-transaction-system.md) - MVCC, locking, and concurrency control
7. [Multi-Database Catalog](07-multi-database-catalog.md) - Catalog management system
8. [SQL Processing](08-sql-processing.md) - Parser, planner, and executor
9. [Memory Management](09-memory-management.md) - Allocation strategies and optimization
10. [Performance Optimizations](10-performance-optimizations.md) - SIMD, caching, and Apple Silicon
11. [Data Types](11-data-types.md) - Value representation and serialization
12. [Error Handling](12-error-handling.md) - Error propagation and recovery
13. [Testing Infrastructure](13-testing-infrastructure.md) - Test framework and utilities

## Code Analysis Methodology

Each section includes:

- **Line-by-line code analysis** with detailed explanations
- **Data structure breakdown** with memory layout and access patterns
- **Algorithm analysis** with time/space complexity
- **Design decision rationale** explaining why specific approaches were chosen
- **Performance implications** of each implementation choice
- **Alternative approaches** and trade-offs considered
- **Integration points** with other system components

## Prerequisites

To understand this documentation, you should be familiar with:

- Swift programming language
- Database internals concepts
- Data structures and algorithms
- Memory management
- Concurrency and synchronization
- File I/O and storage systems

## Code Organization

The codebase is organized into several key modules:

```

├── Integration/                # Platform-specific optimizations
└── Util/                       # Utility functions and helpers
```

## Getting Started

Start with [Core Architecture](01-core-architecture.md) to understand the overall system design, then dive into specific components based on your interests or needs.
