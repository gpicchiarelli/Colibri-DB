## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

2. **Contact maintainers directly** via GitHub Issues with technical details

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Your macOS and Swift versions
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- We will provide a detailed response within 72 hours
- We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process

### Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed. Updates will be clearly marked in the changelog.
