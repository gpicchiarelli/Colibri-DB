## üêõ Troubleshooting

### CI Fails on Coverage

**Problem:** Coverage below minimum target

**Solution:**
1. Download coverage HTML artifact
2. Identify uncovered lines
3. Add tests for uncovered paths
4. Run locally: `swift test --enable-code-coverage`

### CI Fails on Performance

**Problem:** Performance degraded beyond tolerance

**Solution:**
1. Download benchmark results artifact
2. Compare with baseline
3. Profile the affected operation
4. Optimize or justify regression in PR description

### TLA+ Check Fails

**Problem:** Invariant violation detected

**Solution:**
1. Review TLC counterexample in logs
2. Fix algorithmic issue in code
3. Or update TLA+ spec if model was incorrect

### Workflow Won't Run

**Problem:** Workflow not triggering

**Solution:**
- Check workflow triggers in YAML
- Verify branch protection rules
- Ensure file paths match trigger patterns
- Check if workflow is disabled
