# Documentation

Authoritative content lives under the existing `docs/` site and the `wiki/`
knowledge base. This directory holds supporting material (drafts, design notes)
that still needs curation before promotion.

- `drafts/` â€” static website mock-ups or reference notes retained after the
  duplicate wiki pages were removed.
